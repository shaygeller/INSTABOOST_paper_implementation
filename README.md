INSTABOOST - Paper Implementation

This is my attempt to implement the paper:

"Instruction Following by Boosting Attention of Large Language Models", by Vitoria Guardieiro, Adam Stein, Avishree Khare, Eric Wong (2025).

This implementation explores how boosting attention in specific layers can improve instruction following capabilities in large language models.
