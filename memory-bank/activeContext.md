# INSTABOOST Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The current focus of the INSTABOOST project is on implementing the core functionality and ensuring it follows best practices for code organization and configuration management. Recent work has centered on:

1. **Refactoring for Modularity**: Moving from a monolithic implementation to a more modular structure with:
   - Separate files for different components
   - A dedicated `utils.py` file for common functionality
   - A `tests` directory for test-related files

2. **Configuration Management**: Implementing a configuration-driven approach with:
   - A central `config.yaml` file for all parameters
   - Environment variable overrides for flexibility
   - Removal of hard-coded values, especially random seeds

3. **Code Quality Improvements**: Enhancing the codebase with:
   - Consistent documentation
   - Type hints
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Adherence to file size limits (500 lines max, with exceptions for test files)

## Recent Changes

### 1. Directory Structure Reorganization

- Created a `tests` directory for test-related files
- Moved `instaboost_test_cases.py` to the `tests` directory
- Created a `tests/__init__.py` file to make it a proper Python package
- Updated import statements to reflect the new structure

### 2. Configuration System Implementation

- Created a `config.yaml` file for centralized configuration
- Added support for environment variable overrides
- Removed hard-coded values, especially random seeds
- Implemented utility functions for loading and accessing configuration

### 3. Utility Functions Creation

- Created a `utils.py` file with common utility functions:
  - `load_config()`: Loads configuration from config.yaml
  - `setup_random_seed()`: Sets up random seed from configuration or environment variable
  - `get_device()`: Determines the device to use for computation
- Updated all files to use these utility functions

### 4. Code Standards Documentation

- Updated the `.clinerules/tech_stack.md` file with:
  - A rule limiting code files to 500 lines with exceptions for test files
  - A rule about creating modular and reusable components without over-engineering
  - A configuration management section explicitly rejecting hard-coded seeds outside config

## Next Steps

### 1. Testing and Validation

- Run comprehensive tests to ensure the refactored code works as expected
- Verify that different boosting strategies produce the expected results
- Test with different models to ensure compatibility
- Validate that configuration changes are properly applied

### 2. Performance Optimization

- Profile the code to identify any performance bottlenecks
- Optimize the attention modification logic for efficiency
- Explore ways to reduce memory usage during inference
- Implement batch processing for more efficient testing

### 3. Documentation Improvements

- Create a comprehensive README with usage examples
- Add more detailed comments to complex sections of the code
- Create visualizations of attention patterns with and without boosting
- Document the test cases and their expected outcomes

### 4. Feature Enhancements

- Implement additional boosting strategies
- Add support for more model architectures
- Create a visualization tool for attention patterns
- Develop a more sophisticated evaluation framework

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### 1. Boosting Strategy Selection

Currently considering the optimal default strategy for boosting:
- All layers boosting is more comprehensive but has higher overhead
- Middle layers boosting is more efficient but may be less effective for some models
- Current default is middle layers boosting, but this may change based on testing

### 2. Random Head Selection

Considering the impact of random head selection on reproducibility:
- Current approach uses a deterministic seed based on layer index
- This ensures consistency across runs with the same seed
- But it may not be optimal for all models
- Exploring alternative selection strategies based on head importance

### 3. Configuration Flexibility vs. Simplicity

Balancing the need for flexibility with simplicity:
- Current approach allows for extensive customization
- But this may be overwhelming for new users
- Considering adding presets for common use cases
- May implement a simplified API for basic usage

### 4. Test Case Design

Refining the test cases to better evaluate INSTABOOST:
- Current test cases focus on challenging instruction following scenarios
- But more diverse test cases may be needed
- Considering adding quantitative metrics for evaluation
- May implement automated evaluation of instruction following quality

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### 1. Code Organization

- Prefer small, focused functions with clear responsibilities
- Use classes to encapsulate related functionality
- Keep files under 500 lines (except for test files)
- Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes

### 2. Configuration Management

- All configurable values should come from `config.yaml` or environment variables
- No hard-coded values, especially random seeds
- Use default values as fallbacks, not as primary sources
- Document all configuration options

### 3. Error Handling

- Use appropriate exception handling
- Provide informative error messages
- Include fallback mechanisms where appropriate
- Log errors and warnings for debugging

### 4. Documentation

- Use Google-style docstrings for all classes and functions
- Include parameter descriptions, return types, and examples
- Document complex algorithms with clear explanations
- Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes

## Learnings and Project Insights

### 1. Attention Mechanism Insights

- Boosting attention to instruction tokens can significantly improve instruction following
- The effect varies across different layers and heads
- Middle layers often have the most impact on instruction following
- Random head selection works surprisingly well, suggesting redundancy in attention heads

### 2. Implementation Challenges

- Modifying attention patterns requires careful normalization to maintain valid probability distributions
- TransformerLens hooks provide a clean way to modify model behavior without changing the model itself
- Balancing flexibility and simplicity in the API is challenging
- Ensuring reproducibility while allowing for randomization requires careful design

### 3. Testing Insights

- Challenging instruction following scenarios are the best test cases for INSTABOOST
- Comparing outputs from different boosting strategies provides valuable insights
- Quantitative evaluation of instruction following is difficult and often requires human judgment
- Test cases that involve conflicting instructions are particularly effective for evaluation

### 4. Future Directions

- The INSTABOOST technique could be extended to other aspects of model behavior
- Combining INSTABOOST with other techniques like prompt engineering could be powerful
- The insights from INSTABOOST could inform model training and fine-tuning
- The approach could be adapted for other types of attention-based models
