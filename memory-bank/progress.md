## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Approach

The initial implementation focused on a direct implementation of the INSTABOOST technique as described in the paper:

1. Modify attention scores for instruction tokens
2. Apply a multiplier to these scores
3. Normalize the modified scores
4. Continue with the forward pass

This approach was implemented in a monolithic file with hard-coded values for parameters like the multiplier, layers to boost, and random seed.

### Current Approach

The current implementation has evolved to be more modular, configurable, and maintainable:

1. **Modularity**:
   - Separate files for different components
   - Utility functions for common operations
   - Clear separation of concerns

2. **Configuration**:
   - YAML-based configuration
   - Environment variable overrides
   - No hard-coded values
   - Random seed management

3. **Flexibility**:
   - Support for different boosting strategies
   - Device detection and management
   - Model loading from different sources
   - Configurable test parameters

4. **Testing**:
   - Structured test cases
   - Comparison of different boosting strategies
   - Results logging and analysis
   - Multiple runs with different seeds

### Future Direction

The future direction of the project will focus on:

1. **Advanced Features**:
   - More sophisticated boosting strategies
   - Better evaluation metrics
   - Visualization tools
   - Support for more models

2. **User Experience**:
   - Comprehensive documentation
   - Easy installation and usage
   - Example notebooks
   - API stability

3. **Community Engagement**:
   - Open source distribution
   - Collaboration with researchers
   - Comparison with other techniques
   - Integration with other libraries

4. **Research Applications**:
   - Exploration of attention mechanisms
   - Insights into instruction following
   - Applications to other NLP tasks
   - Combination with other techniques
