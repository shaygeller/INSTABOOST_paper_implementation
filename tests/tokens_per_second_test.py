INSTABOOST Tokens Per Second Test

This module provides test cases for measuring the tokens per second (TPS)
performance of the three model variants:
1. Original model (without INSTABOOST)
2. INSTABOOST with all layers
3. INSTABOOST with middle layers only

The test uses random prompts to evaluate generation speed.
